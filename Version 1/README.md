## Counter - Version 1

This folder contains the implementation of a simple counter in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Overview
The counter project uses the `setTimeout` function and leverages the Date object. The counter incrementation is triggered by changes in seconds, providing an interactive experience.

# Files
- **index.html**: The HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the counter interface.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the counter.

# Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The counter will start automatically, displaying the current count in the interface.
3. Optionally, you can click the 'Start counting' button to initiate the counting process.
4. Use the 'Reset result' button to reset the counter.

# Features
- **Dynamic Counting:** Real-time feedback on the incrementing counter.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Styled with CSS for a visually appealing experience.

# Implementation Details
The JavaScript code (`script.js`) uses the `setTimeout` function to increment the counter every second, providing a smooth and interactive counting experience.

# Reset Functionality
The 'Reset result' button clears the counter and allows for a fresh start.

# Notes
Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser for the proper functioning of the Counter.

# My Final Thoughts and an Invitation
That concludes my basic counter implementation! I hope you enjoy experimenting with this version.

Thanks for your time, and feel free to explore and use this simple yet effective counter!
