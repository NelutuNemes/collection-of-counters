# Counter - Version 7

This folder contains the implementation of a counter with the approach of using the export/import function method in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
Version 7 of the counter project introduces the export/import function method, enhancing code modularity and organization. The main logic is in 'script.js', and utility functions are imported from 'util.js'.

## Files
- **index.html**: The HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the counter interface.
- **script.js**: The main JavaScript file containing the logic for the counter.
- **util.js**: A utility JavaScript file containing exported functions for additional features.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the 'Start counter' button to initiate the counting process.
3. The counter will start automatically, displaying the current count in the interface.
4. Use the 'Reset counter' button to reset the counter.

## Features
- **Dynamic Counting:** Real-time feedback on the incrementing counter.
- **Modular Code:** Utilizes the export/import function method for enhanced code organization.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Styled with CSS for a visually appealing experience.

## Implementation Details
The main JavaScript code (`script.js`) utilizes the export/import function method. The utility functions are imported from 'util.js' for additional features.

## Reset Functionality
The 'Reset counter' button clears the counter and allows for a fresh start. The application provides informative messages and visual elements.

## Notes
Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser for the proper functioning of the Counter.
