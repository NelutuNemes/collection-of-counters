# Counter - Version 4

This folder contains the implementation of a counter with an approach using the 'map' function combined with the 'setInterval' function in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
The Version 4 counter project adopts an approach that utilizes the 'map' function along with the 'setInterval' function to achieve the counting functionality. Users can input a specific number for counting.

## Files
- **index.html**: The HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the counter interface.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the counter.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Insert a number in the input field and click the 'Start count' button.
3. The counter will start automatically, displaying the current count in the interface.
4. Use the 'Reset' button to reset the counter.

## Features
- **Dynamic Counting:** Real-time feedback on the incrementing counter.
- **Alternate Border Color:** The border color of the main element alternates every second.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Styled with CSS for a visually appealing experience.

## Implementation Details
The JavaScript code (`script.js`) uses the 'map' function combined with the 'setInterval' function to increment the counter. The main element's border color alternates between iterations.

## Reset Functionality
The 'Reset' button clears the counter and allows for a fresh start.

## Notes
Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser for the proper functioning of the Counter.
