# My Project - Palindrome Checker
This repository showcases diverse implementations of counters in HTML, CSS,  JavaScript and React, using various coding approaches.

Each counter variant is organized in a separate folder:

Version 1 - Counter
Version 2 - Counter
Version 3 - Counter
Version 4 - Counter
Version 5 - Counter
Version 6 - Counter
Version 7 - Counter
Version 8 - Counter
Version 9 - Counter

# How to Use
Open the index.html file from each counter version in a web browser, except for Version 8..
For Version 8 (React), ensure Node.js is installed, run npm install to install dependencies, and then execute npm start to launch the React app.
Interact with the counters based on the specific features of each implementation.
Explore and experiment with different counter functionalities.

# Notes
Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in the browser for the proper functioning of the Counters Collection.
