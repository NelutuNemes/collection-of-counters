# How to Use

Open the index.html file from each counter version in a web browser, except for Version 8..
For Version 8 (React), ensure Node.js is installed, run 'npm install' to install dependencies, and then execute 'npm run dev' to launch the React app.
Interact with the counters based on the specific features of each implementation.
Explore and experiment with different counter functionalities.

# Notes

Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in the browser for the proper functioning of the Counters Collection.
