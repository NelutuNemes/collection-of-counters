# Counter - Version 2

This folder contains the implementation of a counter with a different approach in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
The Version 2 counter project utilizes the `setInterval` function and nested functions to achieve the counting functionality.

## Files
- **index.html**: The HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the counter interface.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the counter.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The counter will start automatically, displaying the current count in the interface.
3. Optionally, you can click the 'Start Count' button to initiate the counting process.
4. Use the 'Reset' button to reset the counter.

## Features
- **Dynamic Counting:** Real-time feedback on the incrementing counter.
- **Alternate Border Color:** The border color of the main element alternates every second.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Styled with CSS for a visually appealing experience.

## Implementation Details
The JavaScript code (`script.js`) uses the `setInterval` function to increment the counter every second. The counter value is displayed in the interface, and the main element's border color alternates between iterations.

## Reset Functionality
The 'Reset' button clears the counter and stops the counting process.

## Notes
Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser for the proper functioning of the Counter.
