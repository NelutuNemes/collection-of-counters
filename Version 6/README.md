# Counter - Version 6

This folder contains the implementation of a counter with an approach involving the use of the 'splice' method in conjunction with the 'setInterval' function in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
Version 6 of the counter project utilizes the 'splice' method along with the 'setInterval' function to achieve the counting functionality. Users can choose preset timers or enter their own custom value in seconds.

## Files
- **index.html**: The HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the counter interface.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the counter.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Choose a preset timer or enter your own value in the input field.
3. Click the 'Start count' button to initiate the counting process.
4. The counter will start automatically, displaying the current count in the interface.
5. Use the 'Reset' button to reset the counter.

## Features
- **Dynamic Counting:** Real-time feedback on the incrementing counter.
- **Preset Timers:** Choose from preset timers for convenience.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Styled with CSS for a visually appealing experience.
- **Animated GIF:** An animated GIF adds a visual element to the user interface.

## Implementation Details
The JavaScript code (`script.js`) uses the 'splice' method combined with the 'setInterval' function to increment the counter. Users can choose preset timers or enter their own custom value.

## Reset Functionality
The 'Reset' button clears the counter and allows for a fresh start. The application provides informative messages and visual elements.

## Notes
Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser for the proper functioning of the Counter.
