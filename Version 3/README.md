# Counter - Version 3

This folder contains the implementation of a counter with an asynchronous function coupled with a while loop in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview
The Version 3 counter project adopts an approach using an asynchronous function coupled with a while loop to achieve the counting functionality. It also allows users to input a specific number for counting.

## Files
- **index.html**: The HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the counter interface.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the counter.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Insert a number in the input field and click the 'Start count' button.
3. The counter will start automatically, displaying the current count in the interface.
4. Use the 'Reset' button to reset the counter.

## Features
- **Dynamic Counting:** Real-time feedback on the incrementing counter.
- **Alternate Border Color:** The border color of the main element alternates every second.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Styled with CSS for a visually appealing experience.

## Implementation Details
The JavaScript code (`script.js`) uses an asynchronous function coupled with a while loop to increment the counter. The main element's border color alternates between iterations.

## Reset Functionality
The 'Reset' button clears the counter and allows for a fresh start.

## Notes
Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser for the proper functioning of the Counter.

# My Final Thoughts and an Invitation
That concludes the Version 3 of the counter implementation! Feel free to explore and use this alternative approach.
